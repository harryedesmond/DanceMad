DanceMad is a data driven community app for dance enthusiasts, this project is aimed at analyzing global dance venues and cultural trends to promote dancing around the world. There will be two main stages to this project, 
**Stage 1, **Data Engineering/ Science project**:** This repository contains data engineering/ science scripts and tools used to gather, clean, and analyze data related to dance venues. The goal is to build an organized database that can help dancers and dance enthusiasts find the best places to dance worldwide. The goal is to use this to showcase my data skillset to potential employers. More features will be added as the project continues.
